testing, and to make the installation go a bit smoother.
You should remove them before moving into a production
environment.

Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from
'localhost'. This ensures that someone cannot guess at
the root password from the network.

Success.

By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that
anyone can access. This is also intended only for testing,
